 * Domain Modeling with Branded Types (Haskell-style Newtypes).
 *
 * ─── Policy on `readonly` (per ADR-0001 Path A) ──────────────────────────────
 * Two distinct categories of interface live in this file, and they have
 * opposite `readonly` policies:
 *
 *   STATE CONTAINERS (no `readonly`):
 *     Interfaces representing state that the application mutates as part
 *     of normal operation — the store mutates `BoardState`, the navigator
 *     updates `GameNode.activeChildIndex`, the analysis service writes
 *     to `EngineState`, registry editors mutate `AppSettings` and friends.
 *     Annotating these `readonly` was an aspirational lie that strict mode
 *     refused to accept; ADR-0001 Path A removes the annotation in favor
 *     of mutator-convention enforcement at code review.
 *
 *     In this category: BoardState, GameNode, EngineState, UISession,
 *     SessionState, ReviewSessionData, ProfileState, AppSettings (and
 *     its nested types), AnalysisEnvironment, AnalysisPalette,
 *     MintingSettings, NavigationSettings, ThumbnailSettings, CardSet.
 *
 *   VALUE OBJECTS (`readonly` preserved):
 *     Interfaces that flow through the system but are never mutated;
 *     new instances are constructed from old ones (functional update).
 *     The `readonly` annotation here matches actual behavior — strict
 *     mode never had a problem with these because the codebase never
 *     mutates them.
 *
 *     In this category: Point, Move, GameMetadata, NodeDelta, EbisuModel,
 *     ReviewCard, SystemMessage, ForestStat, TagStat, ReviewFeedback,
 *     CardLineageNode, RootGroup, ResolveRootsResult, CardLineageTree,
 *     EngineMetrics (the metrics object itself is swapped wholesale by
 *     the analysis service; its inner fields are never individually
 *     mutated — `metrics: EngineMetrics` on EngineState is mutable, but
 *     the EngineMetrics value object is immutable, which is the
 *     idiomatic functional-state pattern: mutable container, immutable
 *     value), AuthState (discriminated union; each constructor's
 *     fields are immutable; new state values are produced rather than
 *     mutated in place).
 *
 * The `Brand<K, T>` phantom field uses `readonly` as a structural-typing
 * trick, not as an immutability annotation; it is unrelated to either
 * category above.

 * domain type lets the SR composable read `currentCard.gradingParameter
 * ?.data?.analysis_config` (`useReviewSession.ts:235`) to override the
 * active palette per card, without re-fetching the wire shape from
 * anywhere downstream.
 *
 * The ACL routes the wire blob through `engine/analysis-config-curation.ts
 * ::rewriteGradingParameterAnalysisConfig` before surfacing — pre-v1.0.3
 * cards carry baked configs with `np.<fn>` references that the proxy
 * v1.0.3 stdlib rejects at call time, and the bit-equivalent rewrite is
 * what keeps those cards reviewable. Residue (bodies referencing fns
 * outside the curated stdlib, attribute walks like `np.linalg.<fn>`)
