/**
 * src/store/migrations.ts
 * Schema versioning for the persisted workspace blob.
 *
 * SyncService PUTs the full GlobalStore-shaped blob to
 * /documents/{user_workspace_01}; on hydrate it GETs the same
 * shape back. When the GlobalStore shape evolves (a field
 * renames, a default changes, an enum reshuffles, an identifier
 * is de-branded), older blobs stored before the change must be
 * brought forward to the current shape. This module owns that
 * forward migration.
 *
 * ── Versioning scheme ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Integers, monotonically increasing. CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION
 * starts at 1 (this module's introduction) and increments by 1
 * each time the blob shape changes. Each migration takes a blob
 * at version N and returns the blob at version N+1.
 *
 * ── Active vs archived ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Pre-v1.0.0 migrations (1 → 2 through 8 → 9) live in
 * `archived-migrations.ts`, prepended into the `migrations` array
 * via spread. Active development happens in this file; the archive
 * exists to keep the migration ledger contiguous so any blob in
 * the wild can still walk forward deterministically (the
 * append-only invariant below depends on the contiguous indexing).
 *
 * ── Append-only invariant ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Once a migration ships, it is never modified. Bugs in a
 * shipped migration are addressed by adding a NEW migration
 * later that compensates. This keeps the migration ledger a
 * stable record that any blob in the wild can be migrated
 * through deterministically.
 *
 * ── To add a migration ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   1. Bump CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION below to N+1.
 *   2. Append a function to the `migrations` array that takes
 *      the v-N blob and returns the v-N+1 blob.
 *   3. Resolve every blob container the body reads or writes
 *      through `witnessedContainer(out, 'path.to.container')`
 *      (the leaf-assertion helper, in `migration-witness.ts` and
 *      re-exported here) instead of a raw
 *      optional chain. A typo'd path then fails loudly against
 *      the runtime-shape witness instead of silently no-oping
 *      and stamping the version anyway — the 47 → 48 incident
 *      class (see the 48 → 49 corrective in
 *      `archived-migrations.ts`).
 *   4. Document the migration's intent in a comment immediately
 *      above the function. Name the fields it touches and why.
 *   5. Test by: (a) constructing a synthetic v-N blob, (b)
 *      calling migrate() on it, (c) asserting the result. The
 *      store-round-trip composition test
 *      (`tests/integration/migration-store-roundtrip.test.ts`)
 *      pins the key-set the corpus produces against the save
 *      path; a backfill migration that silently no-ops shows up
 *      there as an unexplained defaults-only key.
 *
 * ── Missing schemaVersion (legacy blobs) ───────────────────────────
 * Treated as version 1 — the version at this framework's
 * introduction. Pre-framework blobs have the same physical
 * shape as v1 blobs by definition (the framework introduction
 * doesn't change the shape, only stamps the marker), so the
 * implicit version is exactly 1. The marker is added on the
 * next save.
 *
 * ── Failure contract (ADR-0002) ────────────────────────────────────
 * Migration failures throw rather than silently coerce. Two
 * specific failure modes:
 *
 *   - Future-version blob (rolled-back code, or schema bump that
 *     hasn't propagated): throws. Calling code (typically
 *     SyncService.hydrate via store.updateFromRemote) catches
 *     and surfaces a user-visible error message; the blob is not
 *     applied; the workspace stays at defaults; no saves fire.
 *     The user knows their workspace did not load and the
 *     too-new data on the backend is preserved unchanged.
 *
 *   - Missing migration for a required step: throws. This
 *     shouldn't happen given the append-only discipline above;
 *     the throw is a defensive check for the case where someone
 *     bumps CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION without registering the
 *     migration.
 *
 * ── Dev-only hazard: HMR + version bump ───────────────────────────
 * In `npm run dev`, Vite hot-reloads modules in-process without
 * re-running `updateFromRemote`. If this module is hot-swapped
 * with a bumped CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION, the in-memory store still
 * carries un-migrated content; the next debounced save then stamps
 * the new version onto that content and poisons the persisted
 * blob (claims migrated, body wasn't). On any subsequent cold
 * hydrate the walker won't re-run because version >= target — the
 * silent failure ADR-0002 forbids, in the dev register.
 *
 * Mitigation: the `import.meta.hot.accept(() => location.reload())`
 * guard below opts this module out of in-process HMR — any edit
 * triggers a full page reload, which forces a fresh hydrate so
 * the migration runs on the un-migrated remote blob the way
 * production users will experience it. The same call lives in
 * `archived-migrations.ts` (rolling-archive moves are migration
 * edits) so the guard holds across both files.
 *
 * Recovery for a poisoned blob: SQL-demote the blob's
 * schemaVersion to the prior value (`UPDATE documents SET data =
 * json_set(data, '$.schemaVersion', N-1) WHERE ...`); the next
 * cold reload migrates correctly.

 * ── Rolling-archive discipline (2026-05-14) ────────────────────
 * The active body of this file keeps **exactly the latest two

 * migration `N-1` from this body into `archived-migrations.ts`.

 * lives in the archive. Per ADR-0007 (file-size discipline);
 * the prior unified file had grown to ~50 KB / 1100+ lines,
 * well past the 200-line target the ADR calls for.
 *
 * Runtime correctness: the spread above preserves
 * `migrations[i]` indexing for `migrate()`'s `version - 1`
 * walker. Moving a migration is a pure cut-and-paste; bodies
 * are frozen as they shipped (a migration is the contract
 * with the persisted-blob population, not a refactor target).
