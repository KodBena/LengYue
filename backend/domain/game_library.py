"""
domain/game_library.py — value objects for the SGF library.

Frozen Pydantic entities for the library's typed surfaces:

- ``SgfMetadata`` projects the normalizer's meta dict onto a typed
  bundle the service layer consumes when populating ``game_source``
  columns.
- ``LibraryGameListItem`` is the list-view row projection (no
  ``raw_content`` — that field stays on the backend until ``GET
  /library/games/{id}`` is hit).
- ``LibraryGame`` is the full game row including ``raw_content``,
  the detail-view shape.
- ``GameListSort`` is the closed-vocabulary sort enum. Per
  ADR-0008's classification discipline, requests with unsupported
  sort columns surface as 422 at the route boundary rather than
  fuzzy-matching to a closest fit.
- ``GameListFilter`` is the request-shaped filter spec.
- ``ImportOutcome`` is the discriminated union returned per file
  by the batch-import endpoint — Created / Deduplicated / Errored
  on a discriminator field that lets the frontend dispatch
  without `isinstance`.

Pure domain. Imports only stdlib and Pydantic; no SQLAlchemy, no
FastAPI, no db.schema.
