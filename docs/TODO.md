# TODO

This list captures the integration and architectural items
identified during the joint review of the umbrella's `frontend/`
(the Vue SPA, formerly `gogui`) and `backend/` (the FastAPI
service, formerly `fastapi_service`), to be addressed before
public release.

This document is the consolidated successor to the two pre-umbrella
TODOs (`frontend/TODO.md` and `backend/TODO.md`, archived under
`docs/old-todos/` until this merger superseded them).

**Ordering principle:** items are sorted by *implementation
complexity*, not by priority or impact. The intent is that an
implementer can sweep top-down and accumulate small wins before
tackling structural work.

**Scope tags:**
- `[backend]` — touches only the FastAPI codebase
- `[frontend]` — touches only the Vue SPA codebase
- `[both]` — requires coordinated changes on both sides

**Cross-team status:** as of the close of the pre-release
infrastructure sweep, no outstanding action items between teams.
The backend confirmed closure of items 32 and 34 and shipped Commit
3b (response-side stale-bundle compat shim removal); the frontend's
remaining work is independent.

## Tenancy model — recorded for context

The tenancy items (9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 23, 24, 25, 26) relate to a
single architectural decision: **the system is multi-tenant capable
in its data model and access control, but single-user transparent
in its default UX.**

- Every domain object a user authors (`card`, `documents`,
  `game_source`) is tenant-scoped by a `user_id` foreign key.
- All read paths filter on the JWT-derived `user_id`.
- Intrinsically global reference data (`normalized_position`,
  `tag`) stays global; *usage statistics* over it are filtered
  through tenant-owned objects.
- The frontend's auto-login flow is preserved by item 9's flag
  `ALLOW_PASSWORDLESS_LOGIN: bool = True` (now shipped), which
  defaults to on for the local install scenario; multi-tenant
  operators set it to off and provision real accounts.

The current code stamps `user_id` on writes (correct) but ignores
it on reads (bug). The outstanding tenancy items below are the
"realize the tenancy model that already exists in the schema" work.

For the architectural rationale, see `docs/notes/tenancy.md`.

## Completed — do not act on these (reference only)

Items below are shipped, merged, and verified. They're kept here
as context so it's obvious which item numbers are skipped in the
tier sections below, and so nothing has to be re-derived when
reading the outstanding work.

### Backend

| # | One-line synopsis |
|---|---|
| 1 | `SECRET_KEY` auto-gen + persist to `./.jwt_secret`. |
| 2 | CORS: `allow_credentials=False` + config-driven origins. |
| 3 | `datetime.utcnow()` → `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` sweep. |
| 4 | `CardCreateResponse` typed (status + card_id), replacing `Dict[str, Any]`. |
| 9 | `ALLOW_PASSWORDLESS_LOGIN` config flag for local-install vs. multi-tenant. |
| 9a | `SQL_ECHO` config; stops fire-hosing queries to stdout in production. |
| 9b | `assert` → explicit `ValueError` in `update_recall_float` (survives `-O`). |
| 9c | Auth error normalization — no more username-enumeration via diffed responses. |
| 9d | Deleted stale `core/config.py.legacy`. |
| 9e | Resolved broken `domain/pipeline_parser.py`. |
| 10 | `EBISU_TIME_UNIT` injected into `CardRepository` (no more hardcoded `14400.0`). |
| 11 | Domain error taxonomy in `domain/errors.py`. |
| 12 | `creation_date` on `CardResponse`; first-review crash fixed. |
| 21a | `core/logging_config.py` + `configure_logging(level, style)`. |
| 21b | Indexes: `ix_card_source_parent`, `ix_card_tag_tag_id`. |
| 21c | `core/database.py` with `Database` dataclass; engine managed in lifespan. |
| 21d | `_cached_betaln` with `@lru_cache(maxsize=4096)`. |
| 21e | `_attach_tags`: 4-round-trip dialect-agnostic. |
| 21f | First Port extracted: `CardRepositoryPort`. |
| 30a | `Card` domain entity + `CardWithRecall` + pure `project_card`. |
| 30b | `CardService` Port-pure orchestrator; `PositionNormalizerPort` Port. |
| 31 | Typed pipeline DSL (Pydantic discriminated unions). |
| 32a | Domain layer purified: `LineageRepositoryPort`, `TagFilterRepositoryPort`. |
| 32a.2 | Stats purification: `StatsRepositoryPort`, `StatsService`. |
| 34 | Domain-agnostic core (umbrella) — closed via 34a (schema rename) + 34b (wire rename, including the response-side compat shim removal in Commit 3b) + 30b's `PositionNormalizerPort` + the `backend/README.md` "adopting for another domain" section. Ebisu backend is now genuinely domain-portable. |
| 34a | Schema rename (`pos_hash` → `content_hash`, `normalized_sgf` → `canonical_content`); `backend/README.md` "adopting for another domain" section. |
| 13 | `CardRepository.{get_card_by_id, update_card_model}` filter by `user_id` *(tenancy)*. Both methods take `user_id: UserId` keyword-only and add `WHERE card.user_id == user_id`; 404-not-403 collapse preserves the privacy boundary. Code-comment-tagged "Item 13 (tenancy)". |
| 14 | `CardService.create_card` parent-ownership precheck via `read_repository.get_card_by_id(parent_card_id, user_id=user_id)` before insert; raises `CardNotFoundError` on cross-tenant parent. Code-comment-tagged "Item 14 (tenancy)". |
| 15 | `StatsRepository.{get_tag_usage, get_forest_summaries}` filter by `user_id`; routes in `stats.py` forward the JWT identity. Tags remain a global vocabulary; counts reflect only the caller's cards. Code-comment-tagged "Item 15 (tenancy)". |
| 16 | `LineageRepository.{fetch_selection, fetch_lineage}` filter by `user_id`; user_id flows through `_build_selection_cte`. Code-comment-tagged "Item 16 (tenancy)". |
| 23 | `documents` schema gets composite primary key `(key, user_id)` with `user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) NOT NULL`. Routes in `api/routes/documents.py` filter on the JWT identity. Existing-install migration via `scripts/migrate_23_add_user_id_to_documents.py`. Code-comment-tagged "Item 23 (tenancy)". |
| 24 | `game_source` schema gets `user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) NOT NULL`. Backfilled per the migration recipe in the original entry; `CardService.create_card` stamps it on inserts. |
| 25 | `PipelineExecutor` and `_build_selection_cte` thread `user_id: UserId` keyword-only; the materialization query joins `card` with `WHERE card.user_id = :user_id`. Tag-DSL subquery semantics documented in `tag_dsl.py` per the original entry's note. Code-comment-tagged "Item 25 (tenancy)". |
| — | *Resource endpoint reinstated on the Ebisu backend (`/resources/{name}`, `/resources`) with `StaticResourceRepositoryPort`. Not in original TODO numbering.* |
| — | *qEUBO MIT-licensed wrapper, step 1 of the qEUBO integration dispatch (`docs/dispatch/frontend-to-backend-qeubo-integration.md` v1.1). Lands the directory-by-license boundary at `backend/qeubo/` parallel to `proxy/goboard_transposition/`'s pattern: `backend/qeubo/vendor/src/` carries the upstream qEUBO library copied verbatim from `~/preference_optimizer/qEUBO/src/`; `backend/qeubo/runtime/` carries the LLM-derived wrapper adapted from the user's prototype at `~/preference_optimizer/qEUBO/wss3/{service,storage}.py` with the gradient-optimizer / colormap cruft surgically removed (no `colormap.py`, no `_compute_colour_data`, no `colour_table_*` / `*_jab` response fields, no JAB / quotient-space hue config — PBO core only). The whole `backend/qeubo/` tree is MIT; `backend/NOTICE` (new) declares the boundary parallel to `proxy/NOTICE`. The runtime supports `controlled_parameters` and `parameter_ranges` in the experiment config (stored, not consumed) so the still-to-be-written PD route handlers can do encode/decode against them. `backend/qeubo/README.md` is the load-bearing public API contract: the route-author session reads it instead of the runtime's `.py` source per the authoring discipline established in dispatch v1.1. Deferred to the route-implementer session: the FastAPI route handlers, encode/decode logic, requirements.txt bump (torch, botorch, gpytorch, redis≥4), and the FastAPI lifespan wiring. Frontend half of the dispatch (toolbar UX, schema migration, useQeubo composable, bookmarks UI, parameter-meta editor extension) is independent and can ship in parallel sessions. Not in original TODO numbering.* |
| — | *qEUBO REST routes + encode/decode + opt-in deps + lifespan wiring (PD scope at `backend/api/routes/qeubo.py`, `backend/api/routes/qeubo_encoding.py`, `backend/requirements-qeubo.txt`, `backend/core/config.py` edits, `backend/main.py` edits) plus MIT-scope runtime compatibility shims at `backend/qeubo/runtime/_compat.py` bridging vendored qEUBO to modern botorch ≥0.9 / torch ≥2.x / gpytorch ≥1.15 (sample_shape int→torch.Size coercion; float64 default-dtype restoration). Six endpoints under `/qeubo/experiment` per dispatch §2.4; QEUBO_ENABLED defaults to False (researcher opt-in for the heavy deps); routes return 503 when disabled to honor the dispatch's disabled-state contract. Per-user namespacing strips before the wire (dispatch §2.2). End-to-end sanity verified against random L2-target trials in 1D and 2D — zero shape errors, convergence in expected direction. Closes the backend half of the qEUBO integration dispatch; backend status dispatched to frontend at `docs/dispatch/backend-to-frontend-qeubo-status.md`. Worklog at `docs/worklog/2026-04-28-qeubo-routes-and-runtime-modernization.md`. Not in original TODO numbering.* |
| — | *Card-tree backend endpoints (release-scope.md item 3, backend half). Two thin POST endpoints under `/lineage` per `docs/notes/card-tree-backend-spec.md`: (a) `/lineage/resolve-roots` groups input card ids by their game-source root and surfaces unmatched ids explicitly per ADR-0002 (the bulk lift of item 13's 404-not-403 collapse); (b) `/lineage/tree-by-root` returns the structure-only subtree from a verified root with `LIMIT max_nodes + 1` overflow detection that yields a 422 with exact `actual_size` (no post-hoc truncation per ADR-0002). Both methods extend `LineageRepositoryPort` with keyword-only `user_id: UserId`; both CTEs apply the user-id filter at base AND step (defense in depth, matching the existing recursive-CTE pattern). New domain value objects in `backend/domain/lineage.py` (`RootGroup`, `RootResolution`, `CardTree`, `RootedTree`); new error class `LineageOverflowError` in `domain/errors.py`; new route file `api/routes/lineage.py` (wire shapes inline per the auth-route precedent — no schemas module yet because no second consumer); router wired in `main.py`. Pre-implementation, the deferred multi-parent question (`docs/notes/decisions-deferred.md`) was resolved: `card_source.card_id UNIQUE` plus the `check_one_source` CheckConstraint mean each card has exactly one parent, so the lineage is a forest of trees, not a DAG; both card-tree spec files' "open questions" were updated to reference the resolution. One spec deviation: `fetch_tree_by_root` returns `RootedTree` (a small wrapper over `CardTree` carrying `root_card_id` and `game_source_id`) so the route can project the wire shape without an extra round trip — the spec text declared `CardTree` as the Port return but the wire shape requires `game_source_id`, and the wrapper resolves the inconsistency cleanly. Nine integration tests in `backend/tests/integration/test_lineage_endpoints.py` cover: resolve-roots round-trip across two trees, self-root resolution, cross-tenant inputs land in `unmatched`, empty input short-circuit; tree-by-root full subtree, cross-tenant 404, mid-chain 404, overflow with exact `actual_size`, exact-`max_nodes` boundary success. Tests inline-seed because the legacy `tests/helpers.TreeBuilder` predates the item-34a column rename and remains broken at INSERT time — fixing it is part of the deferred test-rewrite arc, out of scope here. ADR-0006 headers retrofitted on `domain/errors.py`, `repositories/ports.py`, and `repositories/lineage_repository.py` (touched under full visibility). Backend-to-frontend status dispatch at `docs/dispatch/backend-to-frontend-card-tree-status.md`. Frontend half (the actual widget per `docs/notes/card-tree-frontend-spec.md`) remains open. Worklog at `docs/worklog/2026-04-29-card-tree-backend.md`. Not in original TODO numbering.* |
| — | *Save-to-disk SGF (release-scope.md item 4, save half). Adds a "Save SGF" button to the application toolbar that serialises the active board's tree via the existing `engine/sgf-writer.ts::serializeBoard` and triggers a browser download. New composable `src/composables/useSgfDownload.ts` (105 lines) mirroring `useSgfLoader`'s transient-DOM-element pattern — no template ref required. Filename derived from the root node's SGF properties (`PB`-vs-`PW`-`DT`, sanitised to `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`); fallback `board.sgf` when metadata is absent. Failures push SystemMessage per ADR-0002. The writer was verified round-trip-clean before wiring (4 real game records spanning 147–459 nodes, plus synthetic SGFs with passes / variations / marks / escape sequences — all property dicts identical post-round-trip), so the implementation is just plumbing; no writer changes. Companion item-4 bullet (pass handling in the KataGo wire) is engine-side and remains open. Worklog at `docs/worklog/2026-04-29-save-sgf.md`. Not in original TODO numbering.* |
| — | *Card-tree frontend widget (release-scope.md item 3, frontend half). Implements `docs/notes/card-tree-frontend-spec.md` against the wire shipped by the backend half (entry above). New SFC `frontend/src/components/charts/CardTreeWidget.vue` (228 lines) with the active / context / stub / bucket projection isolated to a pure composable `useCardTreeProjection.ts` (band 1 — truly domain-agnostic per ADR-0003) and three supporting modules: `card-tree-echarts.ts` (RenderNode → ECharts adapter + tooltip + per-tree header composer), `useEChartsForestRender.ts` (one ECharts instance per tree key, ResizeObserver-driven, dispose-on-unmount), `useCardTreeData.ts` (consumer-side state machine — `loadBrowse` for browse mode, `runPipeline` for active-set mode, `requestCard` for lazy hydration of context-card thumbnails). ACL extended at `services/backend-service.ts` with three new methods (`resolveRoots`, `fetchTreeByRoot`, `fetchCard`); the 422 path becomes a typed `CardTreeOverflowError` via `silentStatuses: [422]` so the system-log surface is the typed throw rather than a duplicated raw API-error message. Domain types in `src/types.ts` (`GameSourceId` brand, `CardLineageNode`, `RootGroup`, `ResolveRootsResult`, `CardLineageTree`, `CardTreeNodeRole`). `src/types/backend.ts` regenerated against the live LAN backend (the npm script's hardcoded 127.0.0.1 doesn't reach the user's install); diff is +208 lines, all additive. Consumer is `ForestDirectory.vue` — Decks tab drives active-set mode (`fetchCardSet` → `resolveRoots` → `Promise.all(fetchTreeByRoot)`), Roots tab drives browse mode (single `fetchTreeByRoot`, empty active set). Old `LineageTreeChart.vue` deleted as superseded; ForestDirectory was its only consumer. Two spec corner cases resolved at the frontend and recorded in the dispatch reply: hot-but-not-warm rendering (`RenderStubNode.isHeadActive` flag preserves the active-accent border without breaking the 4-role partition); expanded-bucket leaves take 'context' role pragmatically (the formal "has at least one active descendant" definition is loosened to "non-active terminal node" with a code comment). `npm run build` (vue-tsc + vite) passes; dev server boots clean. ADR-0007 budget compliance: every new file under the 250-line cap; CardTreeWidget.vue at 228 with script section three lines over the ~150 soft cap (the "~" tolerance covers it). Frontend-to-backend close-out dispatch at `docs/dispatch/frontend-to-backend-card-tree-status.md` surfacing two future-ask candidates (game date in `ForestStat`; multi-root composite endpoint) — neither is current pressure. Worklog at `docs/worklog/2026-04-29-card-tree-frontend.md`. Closes release-scope item 3 at both ends. Not in original TODO numbering.* |
| — | *Backend de-branding round 1 (release-scope.md item 1) — five brand-tagged identifiers retired. State-bearing renames (a)-(c) carry compat shims; metadata renames (d)-(e) do not. (a) `API_TOKEN_NAME = "X-Ebisu-Token"` deleted from `backend/core/config.py`: audit confirmed zero references in `backend/` and `frontend/src/`; the auth flow uses Bearer JWT via `Authorization`, so the constant was vestigial. No frontend lockstep needed. (b) `SECRET_KEY_FILE` default `./.ebisu_secret_key` → `./.jwt_secret`, with a startup compat shim in `_load_or_generate_secret_key`: if the configured target is missing and a sibling `.ebisu_secret_key` exists, rename in place before reading. Bounded per ADR-0002 exception #3, removable in a successor release once operators have had one upgrade cycle. Avoids invalidating in-flight JWTs (which would log every user out on the first boot after the rename). (c) `DATABASE_URI` SQLite default `./ebisu.db` → `./cards.db`, same shape: `_apply_legacy_db_rename_compat(uri)` in `main.py::lifespan` parses the SQLAlchemy URL, no-ops for non-SQLite or `:memory:` URIs, and renames `ebisu.db` (plus `-journal`/`-wal`/`-shm` sidecars so SQLite's crash-recovery finds them in their expected co-location) onto the configured target before `Database.from_uri`. (d) FastAPI metadata title `"Ebisu Spaced Repetition API"` → `"Spaced Repetition API"` in `backend/main.py`. Title is OpenAPI metadata, not a generated type, so `frontend/src/types/backend.ts` is unaffected; backend-to-frontend status dispatch records the change at `docs/dispatch/backend-to-frontend-openapi-title-debrand.md` for awareness. (e) `backend/README.md` heading `# Ebisu — Spaced-Repetition Service` → `# Spaced-Repetition Service`. Algorithm-attribution prose preserved per the de-branding preservation note (the `Ebisu Bayesian spaced-repetition algorithm` reference at line 3, the `In Ebisu terms` passage at line 83, the `Set sensible Ebisu defaults` section heading at line 146, the `Ebisu math` reference in the architecture diagram, the `# ----- Ebisu Math -----` comment in `core/config.py`). ADR-0006 headers retrofitted on `core/config.py` and `main.py` since both were touched under full visibility. Doc updates land alongside: `backend/README.md:62` (DATABASE_URI example), `docs/notes/tenancy.md:254` (operator pre-flight reference), `backend/.gitignore` (add `.jwt_secret`), `docs/playbooks/monorepo/monorepo-plan.md:232,240` (forward-reference parentheticals so the historical playbook record stays intact), `docs/release-scope.md` item 1 (records the mid-execution scope addition for bullets (d) and (e) per the document's own "scope addition requires explicit project-author sign-off" rule). Closes the five retired Trivial-tier entries — header-rename, secret-file rename, db-file rename, FastAPI title, README prose. Not in original TODO numbering.* |

### Frontend

| # | One-line synopsis |
|---|---|
| 5 | Dead 404 branch in `sync-service.ts::connect()` removed; backend contract stated in the docstring. |
| 6 | Ghost `AppSettings` fields (`autoConnect`, `extensionCapabilities`) removed. |
| 17 | `SyncService` three-channel watcher collapsed to single-slot (Option A). |
| 18 | `current_recall`, `halflife_units`, `gradingParameter` surfaced on `ReviewCard` (closed jointly with Commit 4 of the build-error sweep). |
| 19 | `resource-service.ts` migrated to the consolidated `/resources/{name}` endpoint + envelope unwrap. |
| 20 | API and sync errors surfaced via `pushSystemMessage`. |
| 21 | KataGo analysis wait: timeout + abort-signal support; extracted to `wait-for-analysis.ts` primitive. |
| 22 | `VITE_API_BASE_URL` via `src/config/env.ts`; `.env.example` + `.gitignore`. Extended to `VITE_KATAGO_WS_URL` (scope extension of 22). |
| 27-min | Last-write-wins invariant documented on `sendSync()`. The "full" multi-tab version is parked under Future projects below. |
| 29 | ACL fully typed: `mapToReviewCard(raw: CardFromWire)` (closed jointly with item 30 step 2). Wire shape `raw.sgf` confirmed dead and removed; `normalized_sgf` and `default_visits` retained as 34b-Commit-3 stale-bundle compat shims, removed by Commit 3b. |
| 30 | OpenAPI codegen pipeline: `openapi-typescript` dev dependency, `gen:api` script, generated `src/types/backend.ts` (committed), `frontend/README.md` documenting workflow. First consumer (`ebisu-service.ts`) wired. |
| 28 | JWT 401 silent retry: identity-honest re-login as the cached user on non-`/auth/*` 401s (passwordless: silent recovery via `pushSystemMessage('info', ...)`; password accounts: fall through to the existing visible rejection flow). Identity-preserving variant of the original spec — uses `login(cached)` not `ensureAuthenticated()` to avoid silent identity substitution post-B5 finalization. Bundled with the api-client → useAuth callback bridge that flips `auth.state` to `'unauthenticated'` on 401-cleared-token, closing a pre-existing convention-only drift between the two; the underlying pattern is filed as RFC-0001 open question 9. |
| — | Frontend de-branding round 1 — store migration `1 → 2`. Theme identifier rename (`'ebisu-dark'`/`'ebisu-light'` → `'dark'`/`'light'` in `profile.settings.appearance.theme` plus the type union in `types.ts:176`); default card-set id rename (`'default_ebisu'` → `'default'` in `cardSets[id]` keys plus `session.ui.activeCardSetId`, with display name `'Standard Ebisu'` → `'Standard'` and description de-branded); default palette formula name rename (`'ebisu_delta'` → `'quality_delta'` in `analysis_env.symbols` keys plus `palettes[*].delta_fn`). Three retiring TODO entries land as one principled migration in `migrations[0]`. Mid-execution lesson on defensive collision-guards captured in the worklog. |
| — | Frontend de-branding round 2 — file rename `ebisu-service.ts` → `backend-service.ts` (class `EbisuService` → `BackendService`, const `ebisuService` → `backendService`, ~14 imports/usages updated across composables and `ForestDirectory.vue`); localStorage auth keys rename (`'ebisu_jwt_token'` → `'auth_token'`, `'ebisu_username'` → `'auth_username'`) with one-shot compat shim in `api-client.ts` per ADR-0002 documented exception #3; source-comment de-brands in `api-client.ts:3` and `env.ts:26`; doc prose sweeps across `handoff-current.md`, `dispatch/frontend-to-backend-auth-me.md`, `frontend/README.md`, `frontend/CLAUDE.md`, `docs/adr/0002-fail-loudly.md` (algorithm-attribution prose preserved per the TODO's preservation note). `docs/archive/` policy decided as option (a): leave content untouched (preface already in place at `archive/README.md`). EbisuModel and EbisuRecallKey preserved as algorithm-correct domain references. |
| — | Build-error sweep (multi-commit project; ~124 strict-mode errors closed across 11 commits + one regression caught and fixed mid-sweep). The mid-sweep regression became the proximate motivation for ADR-0004. After this sweep, `vue-tsc -b` runs clean. Detail in `docs/archive/handoff-2026-04-frontend-pre-umbrella.md`. |
| — | *Visits-override feature: per-card sticky `visitsOverride` in `ReviewSessionData`; `effectiveVisits` / `setVisitsOverride` on composable; number input in SR tab. Not in original TODO numbering.* |
| — | *Persistent system-log bar: `systemLogExpanded` in `UISession`, always-render `SystemLogPanel`, registry checkbox. Not in original TODO numbering.* |
| — | *Ownership map overlay (release wrap-up). KataGo's `includeOwnership` wire flag is plumbed reactively in `analysis-service.ts`, gated on `UISession.overlayLayers.ownership` — three orthogonal sub-toggles: `continuous` (adjacent gap-less squares filling empty intersections, territory-style), `dots` (discrete confidence markers on empty intersections), `liveness` (small opposing-colour dot inside stones whose colour disagrees with the engine's predicted owner above a 0.3 threshold). New `BoardHeatmapOverlay.vue` is parameterised on `cells × colorMap × shape × scale` so future per-metric overlays compose by reusing it. `analysisService.restartActiveAnalyses()` walks per-board thunk callbacks captured at query-issue time, so toggle changes propagate into in-flight queries via `useAppBootstrap`'s deep watcher. New `decodeBoardArray` helper in `engine/util.ts` handles KataGo's row-major-with-row-0-at-top layout vs. our internal y=0-at-bottom convention. Sign convention follows KataGo's default: positive = white-owned. Schema migrations 2→3 (introduce `overlayLayers`) and 3→4 (split ownership into the three sub-modes; legacy `true` maps to `continuous: true`). Keybindings via `useUserIORegistry`: `c` continuous, `d` dots, `l` liveness. Not in original TODO numbering.* |
| — | *useUserIORegistry context-guard for editable surfaces (release wrap-up). Keys bound in `useUserIORegistry` (arrows, space, m/c/d/l) were leaking through to the global handler when typed inside the CodeMirror 6 editor used by `PaletteEditor.vue` and `CardSetEditor.vue` — `.cm-content` is a `<div contenteditable="true">`, missed by the existing `instanceof HTMLTextAreaElement` check. The auditor's frontend-backlog entry described this as the "Monaco editor" but the actual dependency is `vue-codemirror` / CodeMirror 6; the symptom and fix are the same. Guard adds `HTMLSelectElement` (form-control completeness, free) and `HTMLElement.isContentEditable` — the property already accounts for inheritance, so a single check on `e.target` covers any nested element inside a contenteditable region (CodeMirror today, Monaco if ever added, generic contenteditable mounts). Closes the corresponding bullet in `docs/notes/frontend-backlog.md`. Not in original TODO numbering.* |
| — | *Intensity gradient hue-shift slider (release wrap-up; accessibility). Persisted setting `profile.settings.appearance.intensityHueShift` (default `-43°` — the prior hardcoded value) bound to a range slider in the Other tab's Gradient Calibration view, alongside `ColorDebugStrip`. Engine refactor in `engine/suggestion-colors.ts`: split `initializeIntensityFactory` into `setVisitDistribution` (one-shot from `resource-service`) and `setIntensityHueShift` (called by an `appearance.intensityHueShift` watcher in `useAppBootstrap`); `rebuildIntensityColorFn` produces fresh `IntensityColorFn` closures atomically swapped into the reactive `getIntensityColor` shallowRef so consumers re-render when either input changes. `rotateHueLab` hoisted to module scope. Cleaned up the dead `pchipN(u, ALPHA_KNOTS)` line and the `t = 1-t` double-flip — replaced with named `lookup = 1 - intensity` and `a = intensity`, with a comment recording that the LUT was generated direction-quotient-optimised and the orientation is hand-applied by name. Schema migration 4→5 fills the new field with `-43` for legacy blobs (visually a no-op for users who haven't moved the slider). Not in original TODO numbering.* |
| — | *Analysis-meter rugplot fix in `BoardThumbnail.vue` (release wrap-up). The per-move depth strip under each tab thumb had three coupled defects. (1) `min-width: 1px` on each `.meter-slice` made the first ~60 moves consume the meter's visible width with the rest clipped invisibly via `overflow: hidden` — long games were silently truncated past the opening. (2) The default target of `state.maxVisitsTarget || 1000` was instantly saturated by pondering at `maxVisits: 100000`. (3) Inputs ran through `ecdf(visits/target)` even though the ECDF was calibrated for visit-ratio inputs (a move's share of total visits at a node), not absolute target fractions — collapsing the practical range onto a narrow band of the LUT regardless of visit count. Fix: drop the `min-width` so all path nodes share the meter proportionally; raise the target floor to `100000` (matching the ponder ceiling, with a deeper user-specified `analyzeRange` target still winning via `Math.max`); log-compress visits → t (`log1p(visits) / log1p(target)`) so each ~10× of visits adds a near-constant slice of t; add a sibling export `getIntensityColorLinear` in `engine/suggestion-colors.ts` that walks the LUT without the ECDF and takes alpha as a parameter. The ECDF variant `getIntensityColor` is unchanged — move suggestions and `ColorDebugStrip` continue to use it under its original calibrated semantics. Internally, the LUT-walk + hue-rotation is extracted to a shared `colorAtU` helper. Two visual-honesty refinements: unanalysed nodes (`visits === 0`) render as transparent (the meter background shows through, encoding "no data" honestly); each slice carries `title="Move N: X visits"` for hover discoverability at this small size. Closes the indicator-row rough edge surfaced during release wrap-up. Not in original TODO numbering.* |
| — | *`BoardThumbnail.vue` → `BoardTab.vue` rename (release wrap-up). The component is the tab item in the board-list rail (label, close button, analysis-meter rugplot, geiger dot); the hover-thumbnail is `FloatingThumbnail.vue`'s job. The "Thumbnail" name was a misnomer at this point. Rename via `git mv` (preserves history); two reference sites updated (`SidebarWidget.vue` import + template, comment in `engine/suggestion-colors.ts`); internal header comment in the file expanded to ADR-0006 form (full path + purpose + license) since the SFC was previously carrying a one-line header that predated the ADR. No behaviour change. Not in original TODO numbering.* |

### Joint

| # | One-line synopsis |
|---|---|
| 34b | Domain-neutral wire rename (`sgf`→`raw_content`, `normalized_sgf`→`canonical_content`, `default_visits` nested into `grading_parameter.data`). Backend dual-emitted for stale-bundle compat through Commit 3, then dropped the response-side shims in Commit 3b. Frontend's reciprocal cleanup (`34b-cleanup`) is now unblocked and listed in the Small tier below. |

### Documentation (architectural records)

The codebase carries four ADRs covering both decisions and tenets.
Tenets are cross-cutting authoring/runtime disciplines that apply
to both frontend and backend; decisions are point-in-time
architectural choices specific to where they're recorded.

| Doc | Genre | Synopsis |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/adr/0001-state-mutation-and-readonly.md` | Decision | State mutation model and `readonly` policy. Decision: remove `readonly` from state containers (mutated by design); retain on value objects. Mutator convention enforced by code review, not type system. |
| `docs/adr/0002-fail-loudly.md` | Tenet | When in doubt, fail audibly. Six-level loudness hierarchy from compile-error to silent fallback. Five concrete rules and three documented exceptions. |
| `docs/adr/0003-frontend-portability-and-domain-boundaries.md` | Bounded Context Map | Frontend portability and domain boundaries. The "what would change for a Chess port?" principle. Three-band domain coupling inventory. |
| `docs/adr/0004-minimal-touch-edits-to-partially-visible-files.md` | Tenet | Authoring discipline: when editing a file under partial visibility, only the lines the build tool flags get touched. Full-file rewrites require full-file visibility. |

Plus design notes in `docs/notes/`:

| Doc | Synopsis |
|---|---|
| `docs/notes/analysis-persistence-plan.md` | Future-project design note for server-side KataGo analysis storage. Not yet implemented; blocker is the `isDuringSearch` validation step. |
| `docs/notes/tenancy.md` | System note describing the tenancy model in the codebase. |
| `docs/notes/reflection.md` | Architectural retrospective at the close of the pre-release sweep. |
| `docs/notes/frontend-backlog.md` | Raw frontend backlog (UI/UX items not in this TODO). |
| `docs/notes/deferred-items.md` | Active ledger of items that don't yet warrant a TODO, ADR, or decisions-deferred entry. Working-memory offload. |
| `docs/notes/auditor-notes.md` | Append-only ledger of overarching observations from auditors (Claude orientation passes). Each entry ends with an "Advice for the next auditor" section so wisdom accumulates across sessions. Feeds this TODO via manual promotion. |

### Small — one-file refactors, no contract changes

#### Items 13–16 *(tenancy read-path)* — moved to Completed

Items 13 (`CardRepository`), 14 (parent-ownership precheck), 15
(`StatsEngine`), and 16 (`tree_engine`/`LineageRepository`
`fetch_lineage`) are all shipped in code with explicit
"Item N (tenancy)" annotations. The original Active entries
were stale at the time of `docs/release-scope.md`'s authoring
(2026-04-28). See the Backend Completed table above for the
one-line synopses.

#### 34b-cleanup. `[frontend]` Remove ACL fallback chains

Backend's Commit 3b has shipped, removing the response-side
stale-bundle compat shims (`normalized_sgf`, top-level
`default_visits`). The frontend's reciprocal cleanup is no
longer gated.

Workflow: regenerate `src/types/backend.ts` (`npm run gen:api`)
to pick up the slimmer wire shape, then simplify
`mapToReviewCard` from:

```typescript
sgf: raw.canonical_content ?? raw.normalized_sgf,
defaultVisits: readGradingParam<number>(raw.grading_parameter, 'default_visits')
  ?? raw.default_visits
  ?? 1000,
```

to:

```typescript
sgf: raw.canonical_content,
defaultVisits: readGradingParam<number>(raw.grading_parameter, 'default_visits') ?? 1000,
```

The `?? 1000` floor stays — that's the application-side safety
net for cards with malformed `grading_parameter` data,
independent of any backend shim. Purely housekeeping; no
behavior change.

#### `[frontend]` Tighten `useVariationPath` to `Ref<NodeId[]>`

Optional cleanup. After Commit 5a-extension,
`useAnalysisProjection` exposes a `Ref<NodeId[]>` via a single
boundary adapter; tightening the underlying `useVariationPath`
directly would let the adapter be removed and the variation path
be exposed natively as branded. ~5 lines of cleanup.

### Medium — touches contracts or requires coordinated changes

#### Items 23–25 *(tenancy schema + executor)* — moved to Completed

Items 23 (`documents.user_id`), 24 (`game_source.user_id`), and
25 (`PipelineExecutor` + `_build_selection_cte` user_id
threading) are all shipped in code with explicit
"Item N (tenancy)" annotations. The original Active entries
were stale at the time of `docs/release-scope.md`'s authoring.
See the Backend Completed table above.

#### 26. `[both]` Document the tenancy model in code and READMEs

Now that items 9, 13–16, 23–25 implement multi-tenancy properly,
prominent README sections ("Tenancy") in both subproject READMEs
should describe the model: what's isolated, what's global, the
role of `ALLOW_PASSWORDLESS_LOGIN`, the default single-user UX.
Brief docstrings in:

- `db/schema.documents`, `db/schema.game_source`, `db/schema.tag`
  — what is and isn't tenant-scoped, and why.
- `core/config.Settings.ALLOW_PASSWORDLESS_LOGIN` — what flipping
  it does.
- `api/dependencies.get_current_user_id` — the invariant that
  downstream code can rely on.
- `src/services/api-client.ts::ensureAuthenticated` — the
  assumption about the backend that this flow relies on.

The system-level tenancy note already exists at
`docs/notes/tenancy.md`. This item is the in-code documentation
that points back at it.

#### `[frontend]` Type the pipeline DSL on the frontend

`CardSet.pipeline: any[]` in `types.ts` is the mirror of the
backend's typed pipeline DSL (item 31, shipped). With the
codegen now producing
`SelectStage | TakeStage | ShuffleStage | OrderStage` etc. in
`src/types/backend.ts`, the frontend can adopt these types for
`CardSet.pipeline`. Touches `types.ts`, `useMinting.ts`, possibly
`CardSetEditor.vue`. Closes the largest remaining `any` in
domain types. Not yet numbered; treat as a follow-on to the
build-error sweep.

#### `[frontend]` Merge `CardCreatePayload` with generated `CardCreate`

`types.ts` defines `CardCreatePayload` by hand;
`src/types/backend.ts` generates
`components['schemas']['CardCreate']` from the same backend
schema. Two declarations of the same shape is a drift hazard.
Adopt the generated type at the call site (`useMinting.ts` and
`backend-service.ts::createCard`) and remove the handwritten
version. Not yet numbered; treat as a follow-on to the
build-error sweep.

### Large — structural changes that introduce new abstractions

#### 30c. `[backend]` Single CTE per pipeline run

`domain/pipeline.py::PipelineExecutor.run` loops over
`context_ids` and issues one CTE round trip per id, then unions
the results in Python with first-seen-wins on collision. For `M`
context ids this is `M` round trips and `M` separate query
plans. Replace with a single CTE keyed off
`WHERE card_source.card_id IN (:context_ids)` (or the recursive
equivalent). The first-seen-wins collision semantics move into
`MIN(depth) GROUP BY card_id` in SQL or stay in Python on a
single `fetchall()`.

Observable behavior is identical for users; latency drops
linearly with the number of contexts. This is a contract-shaped
change to the internal CTE-builder API but no externally-visible
change.

Pairs naturally with item 30d — once the lineage CTE is
consolidated, 30c becomes a one-liner. Either order works;
doing 30d first is easier to review.

#### 30d. `[backend]` Consolidate the four recursive-CTE implementations

The same recursive lineage CTE pattern is implemented in at
least four places:

- `domain/tree_engine.py::fetch_lineage`
- `domain/tree_engine.py::build_selection_cte` (the
  `DescendantSelection` and `SubtreeSelection` branches)
- `domain/tree_queries.py::get_lineage_cte`
- `domain/tree_dsl.py::SubtreeSelection.to_cte`

Each one has its own subtle variation (column naming for the
depth literal, base-case predicate, max-depth handling). Extract
a single
`_build_lineage_cte(root_predicate, max_depth: Optional[int]) -> CTE`
helper and have all four call sites delegate to it. Keep the
four public surfaces intact — they're each used by something —
but the recursive machinery lives in exactly one place.
Bug-fixes to one variant currently never propagate to the
others; this item closes that hole.

## Future projects (parked with design notes)

### Analysis persistence

Server-side storage of KataGo analyses so repeated sessions don't
re-pay the compute cost. Design captured in
`docs/notes/analysis-persistence-plan.md`:

- Separate service (`AnalysisPersistenceService`), separate
  endpoint (`POST /analysis-records`). Not a fourth channel on
  `SyncService`.
- Per-node granularity keyed by `(configHash, nodeId)` matching
  the ledger.
- User opt-in, off by default; fine-grained toggles for heavy
  channels (policy, ownership).
- Fail-loud per ADR-0002 — no silent retry.
- **Blocker:** validate the `isDuringSearch` gating rule against
  KataGo's actual behavior on terminated ponders. 15-minute
  DevTools session, not a coding task. Documented in the
  planning note with the corrected polarity (the failure mode is
  terminate-acks masquerading as final packets, not
  legitimate-but-truncated anytime-optimization estimates).

### Item 27 full (ETag-based multi-tab)

Deferred per the item-17 reasoning: multi-tab use isn't a known
workflow, and the minimal documentation of last-write-wins (item
27-min, shipped) captures the invariant. If multi-tab usage
becomes real, the design sketch is in the comment on
`SyncService::sendSync()`.

### Item 32 (zeroconf / mDNS service discovery)

Deferred. Originally specified zeroconf service advertisement on
the backend (`_ebisu._tcp.local.` or similar) and discovery on
the frontend, replacing the fixed-URL config of item 22.
Constraints recorded in earlier discussion: no mandatory
dependencies for Linux users (no Avahi requirement), Windows out
of the box, Firefox without extensions. Large not because the
implementation is hard but because the testing matrix is wide
(three OSes × multiple browsers × with-and-without network
configurations), and the failure modes need graceful fallback to
the configured URL from item 22.

Status note: the frontend's pre-merger Completed table reused
item number 32 for the "Tree-DSL test rewrite" work, which has
shipped under 32a/32a.2 in the Backend Completed table above.
The zeroconf work — substantively unrelated — is preserved here
under its original number rather than silently retired.

---

## Implementation order recommendation

The frontend's build sweep is closed. Items 32a/32a.2 and 34 on
the backend are confirmed closed. Backend's Commit 3b has
shipped. Current shape of remaining work:

**Frontend (small, independent — easiest to interleave):**

- Item 34b-cleanup (~10 lines once `npm run gen:api` is run;
  pure housekeeping).
- Tighten `useVariationPath` to `Ref<NodeId[]>` (~5 lines).
- Type the pipeline DSL — small follow-on.
- Merge `CardCreatePayload` / `CardCreate` — small follow-on.

**Frontend architectural:**

- Item 28 (JWT 401 retry) — depends on already-shipped item 20.
  Compliant with ADR-0002 (explicit, bounded, single retry).

**Backend tenancy spine — closed.** Items 13 → 14 → 15 → 16
(read-path filtering), 23 → 24 (schema migrations), and 25
(`PipelineExecutor` threading) are all shipped in code with
explicit "Item N (tenancy)" annotations. Item 26 (the README +
docstring sweep that documents the tenancy model for operators)
is the only remaining piece and is folded into release scope —
see `docs/release-scope.md`.

**Backend architectural:**

- Items 30c + 30d (CTE consolidation) — do 30d first.

**Future projects (when ready):**

- Analysis persistence (start with the 15-minute
  `isDuringSearch` validation).
- Item 27 full, if multi-tab becomes a real workflow.
- Item 32, if deployment flexibility motivates zeroconf.
